## Chapter 3: Advanced Topics

ArchiCG is aiming at supporting the development of innovative features and approaches for descriptive architecture, relying on graph theory, compound graphs, semantic cartography... While some of these topics come with some implementation which can already be experimented, some are topic for future implementations.

## Chapter 4: For researchers

ArchiCG aims at supporting collaboration between researchers in different fields contributing to or requiring continuous operational interoperability in order to ensure secured digital collaboration within networked organizations. It includes ontology, model driven products and services development, enterprise architecture and service oriented platforms.

In order preventing the production of isolated demonstrators, ArchiCG can provide a core demonstrator on top of which complementary tools (module) can be added for specific demonstration of innovative elements. This is the way it has been used so far.

## Chapter 5: For developers

ArchiCG also aims at experimenting and assessing technologies suited for end to end collaboration, with a particular focus on Web technologies suited for Semantic Cartographies, polymorphic model representations, visual mining, data fusion, etc. One driver is the ability to easily deployed or make available ArchiCG despite the heterogeneity of security policies which can be encountered within the enterprises.

Some technological choices have been made in terms of components, technologies and software architecture which are subjects to discussion. New contributors are welcome for extending and improving what was defined so far.
